    {
      "question": "How do you handle a fulfilled Promise in JavaScript?",
      "answer": "You can handle a fulfilled Promise using the 'then' method, which takes a callback function as an argument.",

    {
      "question": "What is Promise chaining in JavaScript?",
      "answer": "Promise chaining is a technique where you can chain multiple 'then' and 'catch' handlers to a Promise, making it easier to work with asynchronous operations sequentially.",

    {
      "question": "What is the difference between Promises and callbacks in JavaScript?",
      "answer": "Promises provide a more structured and cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks, which can lead to callback hell or pyramid of doom.",

      "question": "Can a Promise be both fulfilled and rejected?",
      "answer": "No, a Promise can only be either fulfilled or rejected, not both. Once it is fulfilled or rejected, its state is immutable.",

      "question": "What is the 'async/await' syntax in JavaScript, and how does it relate to Promises?",
      "answer": "'async/await' is a syntactical feature in JavaScript that allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner. It is built on top of Promises and provides a more readable way to work with asynchronous operations.",
